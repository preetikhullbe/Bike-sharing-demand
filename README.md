# Bike-sharing Demand Prediction

Welcome to the Bike-sharing Demand Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the demand for bike-sharing services. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of bikes that will be rented on an hourly basis, based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors.

Bike-sharing programs have become increasingly popular in urban areas, providing a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. By accurately predicting the demand for bikes, bike-sharing companies can optimize their operations, ensure bike availability, and improve customer satisfaction. Machine learning models can play a crucial role in achieving these objectives.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will explore a publicly available dataset that contains historical data on bike-sharing in a specific city. We will analyze the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and engineer relevant features. Then, we will train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict the bike demand accurately.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data`**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. It includes historical bike-sharing data with information on features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

- **`notebooks`**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions and code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **`src`**: This directory contains the source code for the machine learning models and any additional utility functions.

- **`models`**: This directory will store the trained models once they are saved.

- **`results`**: This directory will store the evaluation results, such as performance metrics and visualizations.

- **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists the dependencies required to run the code in this repository.


## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to add new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

I hope you find this project interesting and educational. Let's dive into the world of bike-sharing demand prediction together!

Happy coding!
